Hi,
As you can see we've got a problem. You're not answering me so I have to tell you about it's importance.

I was sent to this city in order to move the hearts of people towards evangelism. My work is not yet done. I know that you will play a big part in this. That's why we have to fix every issue that can stop us from working for the Lord.

Well, please forgive me but I misunderstood your signs. Women are complicated and I never understood them. You called me to fix a working internet and a working computer:) So I thought maybe I should try to do the step forward. I'm happy now, because you decided not to deceive me on this issue anymore but I think I deserve the honest explanation. 

I know the Bible quite well. I also know EGW writings quite well and, forgive me but I've never found a rule / commandment that would prohibit two single persons from spending time together. So I'n not buying it. Don't get me wrong I'm not trying to convince you anymore but still I think I deserve the truth. Don't worry, I'm a Christian so I can bare a lot:)

You might think that it's not your problem, but still it is. I want to be effective in the ministry and I'm sure you also do. In order for us to work together we should have this issue solved once and for all!

So I urge you for the honest explanation and honest response to the question: what's the real reason for you not wanting to spend time with me?
Your brother in Christ,
Szymon
